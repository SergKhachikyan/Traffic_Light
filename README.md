# 🚦 Traffic Light Detection

**Traffic Light Detection** is a computer vision project that detects whether a traffic light is present in an image using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on labeled image datasets and can be used in autonomous driving systems, surveillance, or smart city infrastructure.

### 1. 📁 Project Structure
```
- images/                    # Folder containing training/testing images
- traffic_light_detector.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook with training & inference code
- model/                     # (Optional) Folder for saved model weights
- requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
- .gitignore                 # Files/folders ignored by Git
```

### 2. 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-light-detection.git
cd traffic-light-detection

# (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate           # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate         # For Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. 🧠 Technologies Used
```
- Python 3.11
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- OpenCV (for image handling)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
```

### 4. 📊 Features & Workflow
In `traffic_light_detector.ipynb`, the following pipeline is used:
```
- Load and visualize labeled image dataset
- Preprocess images and labels
- Build and train a deep learning model (CNN or pretrained like MobileNet/VGG)
- Evaluate model accuracy and loss
- Perform predictions on test images
- Display bounding boxes or classification results
```

### 5. 🎯 Goal
- Detect if a **traffic light is present** in an image (binary classification)
- Future upgrades may include:
  - Detecting the **color/state** of the light (red, yellow, green)
  - Adding **bounding boxes** (object detection)
  - Deploying the model to mobile/web/embedded platforms

### 6. 📌 Notes
- Dataset may include public sources like LISA Traffic Light Dataset, BDD100K, or custom-labeled data.
- This is a learning project and may be improved further with data augmentation, transfer learning, and better datasets.
